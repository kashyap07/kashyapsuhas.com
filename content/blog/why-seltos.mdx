## Story Time

The idea of purchasing something as large as a Seltos (relatively) started when I was at a hill station in Maharashtra in our beloved Wagon R. It had been serving us well until that point: surprisingly good performance when driven solo, a super-narrow fit anywhere attitude, and I had also juiced it up with a sick music setup. Because of its weight, it had zero complaints about off-roading either.

But it all changed when I hit this particularly large pothole at the hill station. The suspension was ruined.

I was lucky enough to find a garage nearby, but the ‚Äúgo-anywhere‚Äù confidence had died down a bit.

It had also been a good 6‚Äì7 years at this point, and we felt it was due for an upgrade.

## Budget first

We set it at a good 15L (12 + 3 expected for the Wagon R). This would be a comfortable budget for most top-end version of sub 4-m CSUVs.

CSUV (Compact SUV) was a must - the main reason to upgrade was something with larger wheels and ground clearance.

We were willing to go up a tiny bit (happen every time, doesn't it?) but this was mostly what we were working with.

And then we got lucky - Spinny and Cars24 started outbidding each other for our car and we ended up at an amazing 4.4L for the WagonR! Sold to Spinny - very smooth process btw.

The budget was now at 16.4L, good enough for top-end versions of every CSUV model.

The wildcard here tho was that we were (very) open to used cars. So the options were very many.

Took me 8 months, but we finally landed on this Seltos.

## Options

Let me roughly go through all the cars I tested during the 8-month period of searching for a car. This is also the part where I tell you why your choice sucks.

For context, this is 2022.

Also, I only do Automatic Transmissions. If you think manuals are superior - good for you but you're stupid.

### Renault Kwid

Pros:

* Good GC
* Decent interiors and infotainment compared to Wagon R
* I like the styling

Cons:

* God awful refinement, horrible engine sound
* Not really an upgrade, same-ish segment
* Terrible AMT
* No manual mode in AMT
* No creep-mode in AMT!

### Hyundai Grand i10

Pros:

* Good interior for the price
* Very refined and smooth engine
* Useable AT

Cons:

* Small, not a CSUV

### Renault Triber

Pros:

* Same as Kwid but longer

Cons:

* Same as Kwid but longer

### Maruti Suzuki Swift

Pros:

* Lovely engine
* I like the styling
* Maruti

Cons:

* Maruti, I'm bored of that AMT gearbox
* And dappa
* Rear space was kinda small, didn't feel like an upgrade

### Nissan Magnite

Pros:

* Actualy liked this
* Good features and package for the price

Cons:

* Same as Kwid
* Long waiting period

### Renault Kiger

Pros:

* Kwid but bigger and handsome-er

Cons:

* Kwid but bigger
* Same unrefinement and bad gearbox issues
* Feels "cheap"

Had almost finalised this. Had IMO matched all my requirements AND would also save good money.
idk got greedy, wanted something "nice".

### Maruti Suzuki Brezza (Diesel)

Pros:

* Comfy suspension
* Massive mileage
* Kinda nice styling

Cons:

* Good lord I've never driven an engine + gearbox that's as lethargic as this
* Just good for mileage
* Approximately nothing exciting
* Kinda bored of Maruti

### Hyundai Venue

Cons:

* (1st gen) Ugly

### Kia Sonet

Pros:

* Pretty good looking
* Incredible engine + gearbox with the DCT
* Great interior + refinement

Cons:

* 16L OTR for a sub 4m CSUV!

### XUV 300

Pros:

* Nice punchy engine

Cons:

* Ugly

### Tata Nexon

Pros:

* Very good engine
* Solid interior
* Incredible JBL music system; better than a LOT of vehicles twice its price
* Incredible handling around corners
* Decent suspension, decent boot, decent space at the rear

Cons:

* Kinda unrefined engine but was ok with it considering the price
* Terrible AMT

The bad AMT was the deal breaker. Had pretty much everything else going for it for me.
New Nexon is a solid buy with its Dual-clutch gearbox. Would STRONGLY reccommend.

### Mahindra Thar

Pros:

* EXACTLY what I wanted, what I needed
* Straight Jeep copy, handsome
* Incredible feel from the driver seat. A proper "go anywhere" attitude
* Insanely good Petrol engine, more torque than the diesel!
* Decent AT box, decent everything else
* ACTUAL SUV

Cons:

* Jeep copy, cringe
* 4-6 kmpl on Petrol LOL
* 2 Seater, 4 is a scam. Also have to a bit of circus to get into rear seats
* Terrible ladder-on-frame chassis. The moment I hit 80kmph the car feels super unstable
* While TDing this, I hit a speed breaker at high speed and my dad almost flew. Veto from him

### Skoda Kushaq/ VW Taigun

Pros:

* Solid VAG THUD
* TSI + DSG is (almost) magic
* Handsome styling

Cons:

* Above budget at 23 ish L
* Small dimensions - and space for the price
* DSG is terrible at city speeds - has an artifical lag. Very annoying in stop and go traffic

### MG Hector

Pros:

* Gadgets
* Nice Fiat engine

Cons:

* China
* Ugly

### Hyundai Creta (used)

Pros:

* Nice everything
* Soft suspension
* Great looks / proportions

Cons:

* The new one was way better but out of reach. Pre-facelift paled in comparison
* No 360 degree camera

### Tata Harrier (used)

Pros:

* Great engine and handling
* BIG

Cons:

* And dappa
* That gen was quite ugly IMO
* Too BIG

### Jeep Compass

Pros:

* Proper next segment, very premium
* Close glass: no longer hear plebs outside
* Diesel engine incredible
* 4x4 is a nice bonus

Cons:

* Petrol was horrible, I wanted a petrol
* AT is too expensive (used), disel manual was 19L ish
* Too long tbh

Loved this a TON. But could not unfortunately find one that fit our budget.
If I were to buy now, this is definitely the car I'd go for, I think.

### Kia Seltos (used)

Pros:

* Amazing interiors
* Very very lovely engine, also very smooth and refined
* DCT is the best gearbox out of every single car under 30L I had tried until this point
* Lovely proportions and styling - almost German looking
* Great Bose sound system
* Lots of bells and whistles - Korean cars doing Korean car things (and I am unfortunately a sucker for those)
* Sporty suspension - super stable at triple digit speeds
* 360 camera

Cons:

* Sporty suspension is very harsh in the city
* No wireless apple carplay/android auto
* Too many people have this / creta. Did not want a normie car

Oh well. This ticked every box.

Started looking everywhre for a good used one.

Found one at a Toyota U-trust dealership, 2 year used, 3 more years left in the warranty, 21k run, nice and clean 0 issues. Finalised it at 17.1L.


## Thoughts post-purchase

1. The way it drives around ghat section is incredible! Was really really impressed by a friend's VW Polo and this feels like a spiritual successor to it.
2. The styling is great. Korean but feels German. Strong solid lines, clean minimal look. Love it in white.
3. 360 degree camera works really really really well. I can't drive without it.
4. Music system is incredible. I should probably upgrade it through some door sound dampening but for now it's about all I really need.
5. The gearbox is simply the best. That's it. I've simply not come across a better one (yes, including VW DSG, fight me).
6. The drive modes are actually useful - eco mode makes it chill to drive with smooth engine operation and light weight steering; While the sport mode tightens the steering a ton, makes engine more "angry", hold gears longer. Great!
7. The terrain modes are ass. Have found 0 use to them. The ONLY thing I'm missing in the seltos is a 4x4 system. Have gotten myself stuck in couple of unfortunate locations because of it.
8. The suspension is actually uncomfortable within Indian city limits - but is super delightful at high speeds and around twisties.
9. Boot space is great, back space is great and wide, is a great "normal" car.
10. Kitna deti hein - 7kmpl in city, 10kmpl on highways üíÄ. If I drive with a light foot, I've gotten up-to 21kmpl on a highway. Unfortunately, my right foot is quite heavy.
