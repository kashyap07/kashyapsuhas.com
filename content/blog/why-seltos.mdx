## Story Time

The idea of purchasing something as large as a Seltos (relatively) started when I was at a hill station in Maharashtra in our beloved Wagon R. It had been serving us well until that point: surprisingly good performance when driven solo, a super-narrow fit anywhere attitude, and I had also juiced it up with a sick music setup. Because of its weight, it had zero complaints about off-roading either.\
But it all changed when I hit this particularly large pothole at the hill station. The suspension was ruined.

I was lucky enough to find a garage nearby, but the “go-anywhere” confidence had died down a bit.\
It had also been a good 6–7 years at this point, and we felt it was due for an upgrade.

## Budget first

We set it at a good 15L (12 + 3 expected for the Wagon R). This would be a comfortable budget for most top-end version of sub 4-m CSUVs.\
CSUV (Compact SUV) was a must - the main reason to upgrade was something with larger wheels and ground clearance.
We were willing to go up a tiny bit (happen every time, doesn't it?) but this was mostly what we were working with.

And then we got lucky - Spinny and Cars24 started outbidding each other for our car and we ended up at an amazing 4.4L for the WagonR! Sold to Spinny - very smooth process btw.
The budget was now at 16.4L, good enough for top-end versions of every CSUV model.

The wildcard here tho was that we were (very) open to used cars. So the options were very many.
Took me 8 months, but we finally landed on this Seltos.

## Options

Let me roughly go thhrough all the cars I tested during the 8-month period of searching for a car. This is also the part where I tell you why your choice sucks.
For context, this is 2022.
Also, I only do Automatic Transmissions. If you think manuals are superior, good for you; you're stupid.

### Renault Kwid

Pros:

* Good GC
* Decent interiors and infotainment compared to Wagon R
* I like the styling

Cons:

* God awful refinement, horrible engine sound
* Not really an upgrade, same-ish segment
* Terrible AMT
* No manual mode in AMT
* No creep-mode in AMT!

### Hyundai Grand i10

Pros:

* Good interior for the price
* Very refined and smooth engine
* Useable AT

Cons:

* Small, not a CSUV

### Renault Triber

Pros:

* Same as Kwid but longer

Cons:

* Same as Kwid but longer

### Maruti Suzuki Swift

Pros:

* Lovely engine
* I like the styling
* Maruti

Cons:

* Maruti, I'm bored of that AMT gearbox
* And dappa
* Rear space was kinda small, didn't feel like an upgrade

### Nissan Magnite

Pros:

* Actualy liked this
* Good features and package for the price

Cons:

* Same as Kwid
* Long waiting period

### Renault Kiger

Pros:

* Kwid but bigger and handsome-er

Cons:

* Kwid but bigger
* Same unrefinement and bad gearbox issues
* Feels "cheap"

Had almost finalised this. Had IMO matched all my requirements AND would also save good money.
idk got greedy, wanted something "nice".

### Maruti Suzuki Brezza (Diesel)

Pros:

* Comfy suspension
* Massive mileage
* Kinda nice styling

Cons:

* Good lord I've never driven an engine + gearbox that's as lethargic as this
* Just good for mileage
* Approximately nothing exciting
* Kinda bored of Maruti

### Hyundai Venue

Cons:

* (1st gen) Ugly

### Kia Sonet

Pros:

* Pretty good looking
* Incredible engine + gearbox with the DCT
* Great interior + refinement

Cons:

* 16L OTR for a sub 4m CSUV!

### XUV 300

Pros:

* Nice punchy engine

Cons:

* Ugly

### Tata Nexon

Pros:

* Very good engine
* Solid interior
* Incredible JBL music system; better than a LOT of vehicles twice its price
* Incredible handling around corners
* Decent suspension, decent boot, decent space at the rear

Cons:

* Kinda unrefined engine but was ok with it considering the price
* Terrible AMT

The bad AMT was the deal breaker. Had pretty much everything else going for it for me.
New Nexon is a solid buy with its Dual-clutch gearbox. Would STRONGLY reccommend.

### Mahindra Thar

Pros:

* EXACTLY what I wanted, what I needed
* Straight Jeep copy, handsome
* Incredible feel from the driver seat. A proper "go anywhere" attitude
* Insanely good Petrol engine, more torque than the diesel!
* Decent AT box, decent everything else
* ACTUAL SUV

Cons:

* Jeep copy, cringe
* 4-6 kmpl on Petrol LOL
* 2 Seater, 4 is a scam. Also have to a bit of circus to get into rear seats
* Terrible ladder-on-frame chassis. The moment I hit 80kmph the car feels super unstable
* While TDing this, I hit a speed breaker at high speed and my dad almost flew. Veto from him

### Skoda Kushaq/ VW Taigun

Pros:

* Solid VAG THUD
* TSI + DSG is (almost) magic
* Handsome styling

Cons:

* Above budget at 23 ish L
* Small dimensions - and space for the price
* DSG is terrible at city speeds - has an artifical lag. Very annoying in stop and go traffic

### MG Hector

Pros:

* Gadgets
* Nice Fiat engine

Cons:

* China
* Ugly

### Hyundai Creta (used)

Pros:

* Nice everything
* Soft suspension
* Great looks / proportions

Cons:

* The new one was way better but out of reach. Pre-facelift paled in comparison
* No 360 degree camera

### Tata Harrier (used)

Pros:

* Great engine and handling
* BIG

Cons:

* And dappa
* That gen was quite ugly IMO
* Too BIG

### Jeep Compass

Pros:

* Proper next segment, very premium
* Close glass: no longer hear plebs outside
* Diesel engine incredible
* 4x4 is a nice bonus

Cons:

* Petrol was horrible, I wanted a petrol
* AT is too expensive (used), disel manual was 19L ish
* Too long tbh

Loved this a TON. But could not unfortunately find one that fit our budget.
If I were to buy now, this is definitely the car I'd go for, I think.

### Kia Seltos (used)

Pros:

* Amazing interiors
* Very very lovely engine, also very smooth and refined
* DCT is the best gearbox out of every single car under 30L I had tried until this point
* Lovely proportions and styling - almost German looking
* Great Bose sound system
* Lots of bells and whistles - Korean cars doing Korean car things (and I am unfortunately a sucker for those)
* Sporty suspension - super stable at triple digit speeds
* 360 camera

Cons:

* Sporty suspension is very harsh in the city
* No wireless apple carplay/android auto
* Too many people have this / creta. Did not want a normie car

Oh well. This ticked every box.
Started looking everywhre for a good used one.
Found one at a Toyota U-trust dealership, 2 year used, 3 more years left in the warranty, 21k run, nice and clean 0 issues. Finalised it at 17.1L.
