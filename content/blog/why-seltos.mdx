## Story Time
The idea of purchasing something as large as a Seltos (relatively) started when I was at a hill station of Maharashtra in our beloved Wagon R. It had been serving me well until that point - surprisngly good performance when driven with 1 person, super narrow fit anywhere attitude, and I had juiced it up with a sick music setup as well. Because of its weight, I had 0 complaints about off roading either.
