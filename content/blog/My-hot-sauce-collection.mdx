I love spicy food. I love feeding others spicy food even more.

I was inspired by the Hot Ones show on YouTube. Was fascinated in particular by **"Da' Bomb"**, how it would make almost every single person on that show cry.\
Here's a nice compilation for reference: [youtube.com/watch?v=GDEVOCTW4qk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDEVOCTW4qk)

I've been collecting good quality sauces from a good 4-5 years at this point. And along with that, one of my favorite activities has been to invite friends / colleagues to my place and feeding (tiny amounts) of hot sauces and seeing them cry.

A classic case of schadenfreude even.

## The Scoville Scale

Is IMO useless.

I've had sauces that have hit up to 2.1 Million Scoville Units and NOT hit as much as some others.

For the uninitiated, [wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville\_scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale) Scoville scale is a measurement of spiciness of chili peppers and other hot substances, recorded in Scoville heat units (SHU).

The Last Dab Apollo from Hot Ones is supposed to be 2.1M SHU, but a good number of people claim it never hits them the way some others do.

### Da Bomb

You ask ANY hot sauce enthusiast for a recommendation and I'm very very certain this'll be in their top 3.

It's just THAT good.

SHU-wise it's nothing special. Da' Bomb comes in 3 variants: Beyond Insanity, Ground Zero, and The Final Answer.\
What's used on the show is the Beyond Insanity variant, which is what I used to have until earlier this year.

Got my hands on Ground Zero and my god! It's pure liquid hell.

I am yet to try out the "The Final Answer" and I do not know if I'll be alive after consuming it. It is very very difficult to purchase it from India (at a reasonable price).

I've made far too many people cry from Da' Bomb. If you want to try it, you should come to place ;)

## Useable Sauces

I'd like to highlight 2 sauces:

1. Naagin Sauce - the normal version
2. Wood Street Sauce Co. - Fresno chili

Both of these are genuinely tasty!

I really enjoy imitating the show with the a lineup of sauces with increasing heat:![](/blog/IMG_20211224_155524~2.jpg)
