I'm bad with money. But BOY is this lens good.

## What's a GMaster

For the uninitiated, GMaster is the top of the line pro-lenses from Sony. If you ever spot a Sony camera with a "G" logo encased in a red rectangle, you'll know that

1. It's a SHARP lens
2. That is technically very advanced and very well built (weather sealed) 
3. And person behind the camera has spent ungodly amounts of money on a camera lens with diminishing returns.

In particular, this is a 24mm to 70mm constant f/2.8 zoom lens.

## How did we get here

I like photos that looks sharp. Very very sharp. I want to zoom into it, pixel peep, crop, what not. That's the Sony brain.

You very quickly get addicted to super sharp images thanks to incredible auto-focus that Sonys come with.

The camera I had before my current one (A7c2) was an APS-c camera - The Sony A6400.

The problem with an APS-c sensor is that I'm very restricted when it comes to my choice of lens: if I want sharp nice and useable lenses, I have to use a prime. Zooms that do not open wide are absolutely terrible on an APS-c.

I started with a 16-75 Carl Zeiss f/4 - which was lovely in daylight, but the moment I went indoors or went to places with a lot of shade, or at night, the photos would turn absolute whack.

I then switched to primes (Sigma f/1.4 trio - which are amazing btw) - but the issue now was that I had to juggle between 3 different (albeit small in dimensions) lenses everywhere. 

And if I was travelling, I could not really carry around extra lenses, so I'd have to choose my choice of focal length before hand. This was rather frustrating to me.

So my search for the "one true lens" began - one single lens that could handle everything in the non-specialised category (no wildlife lenses like tele or macro, or ultra wides). I was also planning to switch to a full frame at this point, so looking at this one made sense.

## Why this one in particular

## Cons

There is a popular saying - "Limitation is the catalyst for creativity" ..which I stringly agree with.

The problem with this lens is that its SO sharp, SO perfect, SO clinical, SO versatile, my brain kinda stop being creative. The photos no longer feel "rewarding" to me. When something is SO stupidly good, the fun kind of starts fading away. That's the issue for me.

Also it's a chonker, and f/2.8 isn't the fastest aperture.
