Karnataka tourism's tagline is “One State, Many Worlds”. From the decent amount of traveling I've done across India, I feel like there is no other state with such diversity in landscape, culture, and history. Every single district has its own unique identity - a feeling that I don't get to experience in other states. Of course I am biased here, but I do think this is genuinely true.

A question I often get asked (from folks from other parts of the country) is - what do you guys eat beyond Idli Vada Dosa?

Here's an attempt at sharing some of the dishes that I tend to have as often as Idli Dosa at home. I cannot of course cover it all, as it is heavily influenced by my upbringing, region, community etc.

## Kadle Kalu Usli / Black chickpea thingy

A simple dish made from soaked and pressure-cooked Black Chana. There's tamarind juice, grated coconut, green chili, and a tempering.

Simple, light, protein-rich, mildly nutty-flavored. I love this one!

Usli can be made with all sorts of legumes, black chickpeas is my personal favorite.

## Puliyogare / Tamarind rice

Cooked rice mixed with tamarind-jaggery-spice paste. Taste is a balance of tangy, slightly sweet, and earthy flavors.

It's popular as a travel friendly dish because it doesn't go bad that easily. We make this paste in advance and generally keep it in the fridge to be mixed with rice when required. Popular for the convenience it offers.

## Pathrode / Steamed Taro leaf rolls

If not made right, this one's going to itch. Made with Colocasia / Taro leaves - layered with spiced rice-dal paste applied in between and rolled and steamed.

Taste is tangy, spicy, and slightly earthy? Butter on top is mandatory. This can also be shallow friend on pan after.

Popular in coastal areas.

## Nuchhinunde / Toor-dal dumplings of sorts

Ground toor dal, coconut, green chillies, spices made into a “mudde” and steamed. The texture is kind of crumbly yet moist. These are quite filling.

Popular dish on my dad's side of the family.

## Heerekayi Uppuli Dose (Ridge gourd spicy-sour Dosa)

Uppu = Salt. Huli = Sour. It's kinda sorta like dosa batter, but you add spices to it, and instead of pouring it on a tawa, you dip vegetables (like ridge gourd) and place it on a tawa.

The vegetable ends up being soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. I'd call this a very home kitchen exclusive dish. Usually made to finish up a week's worth of dosa batter.

## Akki Rotti / Rice-flour rotti

Rice flour dough mixed with onions, green chillies, carrots, coriander, dill leaves etc. This is quite common in Bangalore though.

Crispy on the edges and soft on the inside, needs slow cooking on a tawa. You'll need a sheet to make these as the rotti is slapped of sorts before placing on the tawa (not poured).

## Chitranna / Lemon rice 

The goat. Rice with tempering, peanuts, and lemon juice. Very simple recipe.

It's a bright citrusy refreshing rice dish. Simple to make yet difficult to master.

Deranged people add onions, capsicum, coconut etc to it. Keep it simple yo!

## Mavinakayi Chitranna / Raw Mango rice

Chitranna, but with grated raw-mango! It feels tangier and fresher than regular chitranna.

The raw mango fragrance makes it irresistible. I love this one!

## Neer Dose (Rice Dosa)

Dosa, but the batter is entirely made of ground soaked rice, is very liquidy, and poured over a tawa (and no swirly swirly like regular dosa. The batter has no body).

It ends up getting nice and crispy and soft in areas, a very delicate dish overall. Add loads of coconut oil on this.

The simplicity is what makes this one as the recipe is quite literally rice, water, salt. Also no fermentation required.

## Guliyappa / Paddu / Dosa batter balls

One more dish that's come out of “oh no we have way too much dosa batter for the week” situation. Batter is poured into a special utensil with cups.

Gets nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Dosa batter can be used as is, or you could add dal, onion, green chili and such. Is popular because of the “biteability” (also because it's cute).

## Moode Idli (Cylindrical Idli)

Idli batter, but poured into cylinders made out of “Kedage” leaves. 

Nicely unraveling the leaf enclosure makes it a fun experience (also keeps the thing nice and hot).

The main difference here is the aroma imparted from the leaves. It's a floral and earthy note.

## Bisi Bele Bath (Hot lentil-rice-vegetable stew)

Rice, dal, vegetables, spices. The right combination of spices is what make or brakes this dish.

Khara Boondi is a must as the crunchiness properly contrasts with the sloppy nature of this dish to make it perfect.

A hearty and healthy to start your day. I like the version that uses Navane (millets) instead of rice.

AKA BBB.

## Ragi Rotti (Finger millet rotti)

Similar to Akki rotten but with Ragi because Ragi is good.

You do need onions and green chillies though, Ragi makes it dull otherwise.

I don't really like this one because to get the crispiness of Akki rotti you need lots of oil. Makes it unhealthy.

## Pundi (Different kind of Idli)

Rice and Rava balls steamed like idli. There's a great amount of aroma in this one. Is popular in the coastal side.

Similar to idli, the chutney is the star here. Mild natured flavor stays in the background.

## Shavige bath / Vermicelli thingy

Savory vermicelli dish cooked like upma. Lemon is added in plenty amounts. 

Like upma, this too has many different variations and I think I dislike them all. Prepared mostly for the simplicity.

## Kaayi Halu Ganji (Coconut milk rice porridge)

The Real GOAT. Image ganji, but with sweet and fragrant coconut milk.

Super creamy and soul-fulfilling porridge that's taken to the next level with spicy Gulla Bajji - Brinjal mash paste of sorts. The contrast just hits right.

My aunt in Udupi makes this super duper well.

![](/blog/breakfast%20dishes/ganji.png)

## Pineapple Sheera (Pineapple semolina pudding of sorts)

Upma but sweet. And lots of ghee. Pineapple is a very common additive (in the form of chunks or essence at times).

Fruity, sweet, and fragrant dish - is taken the next level with cooked pineapple bits that add juicy bursts to each bite. Saffron is added to make it fancy.

Brings in the festive vibes.

## Poori Sagu

Poori is poori, deep friend wheat chapathis. But the sagu is a bit different. Green colored and spicy, the focus is more on peas, carrots, and beans over regular potatoes.

I'm honestly not a fan of this style of Sagu tbh. Like the Bombay or Mysore version much better.

## Vangi Bath (Eggplant rice)

One more rice + spice dish. This time with Brinjal chunks added. 

The soft Eggplant chunks give it a nice mouth feel. The masalas for these rice dishes are often pre-made and sold in stores.

## Kayi Sasive Anna (Coconut-masala rice)

Another one. Similar to Chitranna but with a paste made with lot of coconut.

My dad makes a killer version.

## Mangalore Buns

Deep friend buns made with over-ripe banana. It's soft and gluten-formed-network-y on the inside, and slightly crispy on the outside.

The over ripe bananas give it a nice sweet taste. Popular and very commonly had as a breakfast dish in Mangalore!

![](/blog/breakfast%20dishes/buns.png)

## Avrekalu Usli (Hyacinth Beans thingy)

Similar to the earlier mentioned usli but I wanted to mention this one because Avare kalu or Hyacinth beans are very loved in Bangalore.

This thing is added to anything and everything and there's even a festival on this during winter.

## Golibaje (Deep-fried dough balls)

Soft and melt in your mouth deep fried dough balls made from maida, curds, lots of ginger, green chilli, and some baking soda.

Golden and smooth with bits of crispiness on the outside, very airy light and soft on the inside. Mild and gentle in flavor.

Commonly served a tea time snack, but is also had has a breakfast dish in coastal Karanataka.

## Chow Chow Bath (Sweet and Savory semolina duo)

One portion of Khara Bath (Upma) + One portion of Kesari Bath (Sheera).

An interesting amalgamation of two distinct Rava dishes that's quite popular in Bangalore.

Some people tend to mix the two make a sweet and savory semolina dish. Doesn't make sense but also makes a lot of sense.
