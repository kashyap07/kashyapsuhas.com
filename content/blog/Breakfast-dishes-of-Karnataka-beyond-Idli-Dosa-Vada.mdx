Karnataka tourism's tagline is “One State, Many Worlds”. From the decent amount of traveling I've done across India, I feel like there is no other state with such diversity in landscape, culture, and history. Every single district has its own unique identity - a feeling that I don't get to experience in other states. Of course I am biased here, but I do think this is genuinely true.  

  

A question I often get asked (from folks from other parts of the country) is - what do you guys eat beyond Idli Vada Dosa?  

Here's an attempt at sharing some of the dishes that I tend to have as often as Idli Dosa at home. I cannot of course cover it all, as it is heavily influenced by my upbringing, region, community etc.

## Kadle Kalu Usli / Black Chana stir-fry of sorts

A simple dish made from soaked and pressure-cooked black chana. There's tamarind juice, grated coconut, green chili, and a tempering.

Simple, light, protein-rich, mildly nutty-flavored. I love this one!

Usli can be made with all sorts of legumes, black chickpeas is my personal favorite.

## Puliyogare / Tamarind rice

Cooked rice mixed with tamarind-jaggery-spice paste. Taste is a balance of tangy, slightly sweet, and earthy flavors.

It's popular as a travel friendly dish because it doesn't go bad that easily. We make this paste in advance and generally keep it in the fridge to be mixed with rice when required. Popular for the convenience it offers.

## Pathrode / Steamed Taro leaves rolls

If not made right, this one's going to itch. Made with Colocasia / Taro leaves - layered with spiced rice-dal paste applied in between and rolled and steamed.

Taste is tangy, spicy, and slightly earthy? Butter on top is mandatory. This can also be shallow friend on pan after.

Popular in coastal areas.

## Nuchhinunde / Toor-dal dumplings of sorts

Ground toor dal, coconut, green chillies, spices made into a “mudde” and steamed. The texture is kind of crumbly yet moist. These are quite filling.

Popular dish on my dad's side of the family.

## Heerekayi Uppuli Dose

Uppu = Salt. Huli = Sour. It's kinda sorta like dosa batter, but you add spices to it, and instead of pouring it on a tawa, you dip vegetables (like ridge gourd) and place it on a tawa.

The vegetable ends up being soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. I'd call this a very home kitchen exclusive dish. Usually made to finish up a week's worth of dosa batter.

## Akki Rotti / Rice-flour rotti

Rice flour dough mixed with onions, green chillies, carrots, coriander, dill leaves etc. This is quite common in Bangalore though.

Crispy on the edges and soft on the inside, needs slow cooking on a tawa. You'll need a sheet to make these as the rotti is slapped of sorts before placing on the tawa (not poured).
