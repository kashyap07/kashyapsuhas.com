## The What

"Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation" - is what their site says.  
Sure, but that's not it.

"Stories capture the “known good” states of UI components. They’re a pragmatic, reproducible way to keep track of UI edge cases. Reuse stories to power automated tests."  
Suure, but nahh.

Scroll down a decent bit and you'll finally hit the  
"Storybook brings together UI, examples, and documentation in one place. That helps your team adopt existing UI patterns."

Now THAT's what Storybook is!

## The Why

Imagine a team of 5 devs working on the same Frontend application. Dev A creates component A, thinks it's pretty good, asks dev B to review, and goes on to using it in several places.

6 months in, Dev C wants to do a task that component A did, but is simply unaware of its existence. The project has grown too fast and there are 30+ components lying in your components folder.

Scenario A:  
The project does not have Storybook.  
Dev C starts creating this component that already exists in the codebase but maybe just hidden because of a bad name or bad location. 2 weeks pass and now when Dev A review the code Dev C suddenly gets to know of their wasted effort. "Oh no!".

Scenario B:  
The project has Storybook.  
Dev C opens the storybook, checks if there's any component that matches their requirement, spots one, easily learns how to use it because there's free documentation, and saves those nice 2 weeks. "Nice".

That's really it -  
It's a nice little tool to document your components and tell others that it exists and show how to use them. That's really it.  
It adds tiny bit of effort to add a storybook each time a component is created, but the end result, IMO, is very well worth it.

## The How

Follow the documentation from their site: [storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install "storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install")

### Configure TS Paths

Create `main.js` under `.storybook` folder and add the following

```typescript
const TsconfigPathsPlugin = require("tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  stories: ["../src/**/*.stories.mdx", "../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)"],
  addons: [
    "@storybook/addon-links",
    "@storybook/addon-essentials",
    "@storybook/addon-interactions",
  ],
  framework: "@storybook/react",
  webpackFinal: async (config) => {
    config.resolve.plugins = [
      ...(config.resolve.plugins || []),
      new TsconfigPathsPlugin({
        extensions: config.resolve.extensions,
      }),
    ];
    return config;
  },
};
```

### Add Tailwind/use NextJS components

```typescript
import '!style-loader!css-loader!postcss-loader!tailwindcss/tailwind.css';
import '../src/styles/globals.css';
import { themes } from '@storybook/theming';
import * as NextImage from 'next/image';

export const parameters = {
  actions: { argTypesRegex: '^on[A-Z].*' },
  controls: {
    matchers: {
      color: /(background|color)$/i,
      date: /Date$/,
    },
  },
  docs: {
    theme: themes.dark,
  },
};

const OriginalNextImage = NextImage.default;

Object.defineProperty(NextImage, 'default', {
  configurable: true,
  value: props => <OriginalNextImage {...props} unoptimized loader={({ src }) => src} />,
});
```

The codeblock also sets dark theme, if your projects primarily is a dark themed one.

### Creating individual stories

Create a .stories.tsx for each component, import the component and pass some values to them.

Here's an example story for a button component:

```typescript
import Button from './index';
import { ComponentMeta, ComponentStory } from '@storybook/react';

export default {
  title: 'Button',
  component: Button,
} as ComponentMeta<typeof Button>;

const PrimaryTemplate: ComponentStory<typeof Button> = args => <Button {...args}>Click me!</Button>;
const TextTemplate: ComponentStory<typeof Button> = args => <Button {...args}>Click me!</Button>;

export const Primary = PrimaryTemplate.bind({});
Primary.args = {
  variant: 'primary',
};

export const Text = TextTemplate.bind({});
Text.args = {
  variant: 'text',
};
```

With some npm scripts you should be able to have it up and running on a separate port.

```typescript
"storybook": "start-storybook -p 6006",
"build-storybook": "build-storybook",
```

Add `storybook.js` and make your (future) life easy!
