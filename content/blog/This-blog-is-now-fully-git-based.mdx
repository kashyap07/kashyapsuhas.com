I like Markdown.\
I like owning my content.\
I like React.\
I like the combination of Markdown and React, aka MDX.\
I like my content in a format that does not need "migrating".\
I like committing to the master branch and watching Vercel do its back flips to bring my text to life.

I dislike going to a computer and modifying my blog post in the form of code just to fix a typo.\
I dislike writing drafts of "brilliant" ideas on my phone only to never publish it.\
I dislike having to pay for an external server with a db for basic text.

I get my ideas at random places and random times, and I want to get them up and published right away.

Say hello to [TinaCMS.](https://tina.io/)

## Tina

Tina can do a LOT of things, but I'll focus on the things that matter.

Tina at it's core, is a git-based headless CMS which also happens to be OSS.

Essentially,

1. Regardless of me using Tina or not, my posts stay *exactly* where they are - in my website repo.
2. Every time I hit save (through Tina cloud), it quietly makes a commit straight to my master - making Vercel deploy it within seconds.
3. Editor is shipped along with the website - but only accessible to me through /tina route. This website's "backend" lives as a route on the "frontend".
4. Version control is baked in, because it's git.
5. I can access this on my PHONE!

I love Markdown based blog for all the right reasons - simplicity, format-longevity, content ownership (no vendor lock in, monthly fee etc), and with MDX having access to React component even. \
Also the build is static, content loads super fast.

But the friction is a lot to handle. Tina is the perfect piece to solve this pizzle.

Also, the set up process with NextJS is very easy - see [https://tina.io/docs/frameworks/next/app-router](https://tina.io/docs/frameworks/next/app-router)

Also comes with a very nice media manager!

Let me know if this works out for you.

You should expect a LOT more posts (short and long) coming from me in the near future \:D

As always, this website's code is open sourced under MIT at [https://github.com/kashyap07/kashyapsuhas.com](https://github.com/kashyap07/kashyapsuhas.com)

Enjoy!
