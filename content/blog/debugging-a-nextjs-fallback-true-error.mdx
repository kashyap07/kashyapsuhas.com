There's currently a bug with my NextJs SSG implementation - `fallback: true` doesn't seem to work.

The way NextJs's fallback should work is that I pass an empty array as paths, and then say fallback is true - ok too much to explain, just read the docs: [nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths "https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths")

## Current implementation

Here&apos;s the way the blog is set up currently -
Blog mdx files are in-repo, they&apos;re updated through forestry.io (or manually by me), they are essentially not served from external sources. So everytime there is an update to the repo, the entire project is re-built by Vercel and thus I get the latest updated blog.

To get this to work, in my "slug" file - the individual blog file, I open the file through `fs.readFileSync('Blog/' + slug + '.mdx');` (hardcoded) and pass it onto `next-mdx-remote`&apos;s `serialize` function.

## The issue

I was searching around and game across this issue on Guthub - https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/13013. This got me thinking, "what&apos; the ONE thing that differs between local and production?" - messed around and found that it was `readFileSync`&apos;s path. It was taking in an absolute path that dirrered between local and Vercel.

## The fix

Changed the path to be relative to the project root.
The new line of code is:

<pre>
  fs.readFileSync(path.join(process.cwd(), 'Blog', `${slug}.mdx`), 'utf8');
</pre>

That&apos;s it, folks!
Enjoy the day.
