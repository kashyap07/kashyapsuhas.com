I am going to assume you already know what http tunnels are for, and also [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).

## 1

Multiple ways to get to this tab, including the tower icon bottom left or good old cmd+shift+p

## 2

Choose your port of choice, and sign in through MS/GitHub. Very self-explanatory.

## 3

Change visibility to public, and optionally change protocol to https if requied.

## 4

This dialog box shows up the first time you access the tunnel link. And that's about that.

And et voil√†! We have a free ngrok alternative right within our beloved Visual Studio Code!
