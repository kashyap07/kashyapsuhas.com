I’m no pro, but I’ve learnt a thing or two, and let me share them here.

Will keep this updated with new tips as and when I learn them.

1. When zoomed in, it’s quite difficult to use the screen to track a moving subject. Use the evf, it’s way better!
2. You’d typically want to punch-in into a photo that’s been shot to show the details. For which, you do not want to set high ISO - without which the photo will be far too grainy for any kind of use. Use low ISO.
3. You’ll automatically have to shoot at lower shutter speeds if you set the ISO low, only to end up with a blurry image. 2 ways to counteract this:
   1. Set low shutter speed (on a stationary subject) and set your burst mode to maximum. Shoot bursts only; You’ll get 1 useable photo out of 20 photos or so. But it’s worth it.
   2. Support the lens with the other hand, breathe in/out, hold it, and tense up your core muscles. Breathing generally adds some shake to photos, we want to avoid that.
