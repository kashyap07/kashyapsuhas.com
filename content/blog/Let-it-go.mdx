Some words of enlightenment from Swami Kashyapananda.

I was on a 2 week Kolkata trip recently. \
And I did not really enjoy Bengali sweets all too much.

Blasphemous, I know.

Let me explain.

I tried a good amount of options from all over Kolkata. I don't think you can call my opinion ill-formed.
Insert heatmap

I tried from popular establishments recommended by many.
Insert names.

I tried multitude of options. If there's a suggestion you have, it is very likely that I have a photo of me trying it.
Also, I tried the popular ones from multiple locations.

Here's my observations:
The ones made out of curdled milk are genuinely good. Lovely texture and a melt in your mouth feel.

Roshogollo actually like freshly curdled milk, as opposed to rubber-like Rasgulla that you get elsewhere.
ChomChoms, Abar Khabos, Roshmalai - all had fantastic texture.

But the taste.

I did not really like the taste.

From what I understand, authentic Bengali sweets are made using date palm jaggery “Nulen Gur” and not sugar.
Not a fan of it at all.
It felt very synthetic / artificial to me. Kinda like stevia.

It could be that:

1. In just not used to it. So I find it aliens and off-putting.
2. I don't have a sweet tooth. I'm just not a sweets person.
3. All Bengalis have bad taste in sweets.
4. I have bad taste in sweets.

So why should I be doing about this?

Nothing.

Food preferences are incredibly personal.
Childhood plays a massive role in it.

You could serve me the exact same curd rice every single day and I'd still enjoy it.

I know of one too many who go around claiming Rameshwaram cafe is “overhyped” and that they know better than thousands of visitors who enjoy their ghee-soaked doseys every day.

You might put in a lot of effort doing something or suggest something close to your heart.
Only for a person that you care for or respect to come in and say it's mid.

Don't be offended / sad.

Happens.

Their thoughts might not be malicious, they're just different from you.

Not everyone might like even if you're doing everything right.

Neither of you are wrong.

Just different.

So

Relax.

And let it go.
