A lil' phrase I'd like to present on street-photography mindset.\
This builds on top of my post on the GMaster in a way: [blog/bought-a-gmaster](https://www.kashyapsuhas.com/blog/bought-a-gmaster)

I got my self a tiny manual lens recently, and I've been having a TON of fun with it. 

It's super portable, looks (very) cool, and is a joy to play around with. I had mentioned about "limitation is the catalyst for creativity" describing my “issues” with the GM, and this has been the perfect solution to my problem.

This is a 35mm APSC-sized f/1.2 manual lens from TTArtisan.

Walking around with a lens of many limitations, I quickly realised that I had been obsessing far too much on capturing the “perfect moment”; Spending way too much time on fiddling with the right settings every time, that I had stopped being really in the moment and observing things around me - which is what street photography is honestly all about.

The more you spend looking at your camera screen, the less you spend noticing life happening in front of you.\
Capture those natural, mundane moments. Not everything needs to an isolated shallow dof subject with creamy bokeh.

f/8 sits in a sweet spot between some shallow enough dof (at least on a full-frame 35mm sized sensor) to get nice looking shots and wide enough dof coverage to have most things in focus with great sharpness.

In fact, f/8 in particular doesn't even matter tbh.\
The crux is stop obsessing over technical details and enjoy the beauty of street photography letting the camera fade in the background.
