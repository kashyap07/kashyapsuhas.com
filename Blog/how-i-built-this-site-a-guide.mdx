**Hello World!**

I've been wanting to build a site to share my experiences in life - be it tech, food, or travel - for quite a while. I'm not quite sure what exactly made me start building one, but I did so about a month ago. Paid for a domain and started going at it right away. I figured documenting how I did this could probably be helpful to someone or myself in the future. Massive shout-outs to [Josh Comeau](https://twitter.com/joshwcomeau)'s beautiful [website](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) - who has detailed explanation of how he built his blog and my friend [Shreyash](https://twitter.com/shreyash14s) who helped me a ton along the way.

## Go Daddy!

Step 1 of doing anything web - buying a domain for it. You build it or not, you gotto buy one. This is was something new to me, and I wasn't aware of all the intricasies of linking a hosting site to a domain. So I went along with GoDaddy - might not be the best bang for the buck, but there are tons of videos/articles on the internet detailing the steps to link it with your hosting provider.

The pricing was 299rs (year1) + 999(year2) + tax. They upsell you a lot, you don't need any of those. Especially the "free" website builder. This was for `.com` site. `.in`, `.co.in` are a lot more cheaper.

Once you make the payment, you'll have to wait for a while for them to allocate it to you. Meanwhile I started setting up the project itself - a nextjs app.

## The Tech Stack

Here's all the tech that I happened to use; I'll explain about each later on -  
`NextJs` as the React Framework. This does SO MANY THINGS. The developer experience also happens to be amazing. Just `create-next-app`, add a few line and you're set. You now have an amazingly responsive Statically Generated Site.

`Heroku` as the hosting provider. I did not know about Vercel/Netlify at the point I set this up. They could be better, I will explore about them in the future. For now, Heroku did everything I wanted: 1 click to link up to my project git repo see: [github repo](https://github.com/kashyap07/kashyapsuhas.com), (almost) 0-configure auto-deploy whenever I commit to the `main` branch with good build logs,and a reasonably low cost as well. I'm currently paying for the Hobby tier which costs me 7 USD per month.

`Tailwind` for my styling. I'm still not used to looking at all the ugly essays of class names, but I'll you this - the developer experience is Amazing. Without Tailwind I wouldn't have been able to do reasonable and responsive styling this quick. I would highly recommend you try this in your next endeavour.

`MDX` for blog posts. I wasn't happy enough with simple markdown posts - so I looked for this. You can have React components in your Markdown with this.

I don't have a database at the moment. There is a 'backend'of sorts that is provided by NextJs. With the `/api` route I can write Node code to do secret backendy things - like fetching those Instagram images you see on the front page.
