## Or what I think is good

I attended a tech talk hosted by GeekyAnts a few months ago. The speaker, [https://twitter.com/siddharthkp](https://twitter.com/siddharthkp "Siddharth"), who happens to be a design system engineer at Github talked about how they go about creating components over there.

I hadn't really given a thought to how re-useable components should be made - I just created a React FC and passed in some props or a child.
