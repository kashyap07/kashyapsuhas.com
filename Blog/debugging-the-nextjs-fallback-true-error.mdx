There's currently a bug with my NextJs SSG implementation - `fallback: true` doesn't seem to work. 

The way NextJs's fallback should work is that I pass an empty array as paths, and then say fallback is true - ok too much to explain, just read the docs: [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths "https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths")

## Maybe I should re-read the docs.

There's some new stuff in there
