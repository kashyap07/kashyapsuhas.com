## The z-index problem in CSS

You've likely come across - so have I - no matter how high of a z-index value you set, the element simply refuses to go on top of the other element.

## Fix

The reason this happens is because of "stacking contexts" in CSS. Essentially, think of Photoshop layers and then re-order your elements in the DOM structure so that they're at the same level.

Josh Comeau's blog post explains this extremely well, do go through it thoroughly: [joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts)
