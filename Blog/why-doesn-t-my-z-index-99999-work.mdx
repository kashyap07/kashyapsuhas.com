## The z-index problem in CSS

You've likely come across - so have I - no matter how high of a z-index value you set, the element simply refuses to go on top of the other element.

Some common examples - 

1. A small button that protrudes out of your side bar that lets you close said side bar
2. User cards with their profile picture sticking out

## Fix

The reason this happens is because of "stacking context" in CSS. Essentially, think of Photoshop layers and then re-order your elements in the DOM structure so that they're at the same level.

Josh Comeau's blog post explains this extremely well, do go through it thoroughly: [https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts/](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts/ "joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts/")
